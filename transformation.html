                uses even more oxygen and energy, using up more food and causing Luffy to pant heavily. The increase in
                his metabolism causes him to be hungrier than usual or even have a paralysis type effect after prolonged
                use of it. In Luffy's case, his organs and blood vessels are made of rubber allowing them to expand and
                contract at greater rates without tearing. Essentially, Luffy increases the blood flow by forcing more
                blood through his blood vessels thus increase his fighting ability. This mode's enhancements to Luffy's

                requiring the torso to act as an interface for his various limbs. Luffy blows so much air into his body
                that when they are all focused on a single limb, they become the size equivalent to (or greater than)
                that of a giant's, if anything resembling Oars' size. Used with his already-strong physiology, this

                is incapable of standing still on the ground, and instead constantly bounds on the spot. This form was

                and used his "Manpuku Version" form.[5] Due to the increase in Luffy's metabolism Gear 4 causes, he is

                not significantly expand, with his forearms, legs, and upper torso being only slightly enlarged and the
                rest of his body retaining its normal proportions. The spread of Haki is slightly more limited, as it
                does not appear to extend onto Luffy's shoulders and upper body. However, Luffy's hair becomes
                flame-shaped like his Haki and sticks up.
